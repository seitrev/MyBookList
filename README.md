# Lab 02 – Book Class and Object Manipulation

## Description
This laboratory activity focuses on object-oriented programming in Java.  
The task involves creating a `Book` class, instantiating multiple book objects, manipulating their properties, and demonstrating the use of constructors and methods.  
The activity also applies basic programming concepts such as arrays and loops in an OOP context.

---

## Objectives
- Define and implement a class in Java  
- Instantiate and manipulate objects of a class  
- Demonstrate the use of properties, constructors, and methods  
- Apply basic programming concepts in an object-oriented programming (OOP) setting

---

## Concepts Applied
- Classes and objects  
- Properties (fields/attributes)  
- Methods (including display and update methods)  
- Constructors  
- Arrays of objects  
- Loops for object traversal  
- Basic input/output operations

## Project Structure
Lab02-Book-Class/
├── src/
│ ├── Book.java
│ └── MyBookList.java
└── README.md

### File Description
- **Book.java** – Defines the `Book` class with properties such as title, author, year published, and current page. Includes methods to display details and update the current page or author.  
- **MyBookList.java** – Contains the main method that creates `Book` objects, manipulates them according to the lab instructions, and demonstrates object-oriented operations.

---

## How to Run the Program
1. Save both `Book.java` and `MyBookList.java` in the `src` folder of your project.  
2. Open the project in a Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).  
3. Run `MyBookList.java`.  
4. The program will create book objects, display their details, and demonstrate updates to their properties as instructed.

---

## System Features
- Create multiple `Book` objects with properties: title, author, year published, and current page.  
- Display the details of each book using a `displayDetails` method.  
- Update the current page of a book using the `changePage` method.  
- Update the author of a book.  
- Store all book objects in an array and loop through them to display titles of books published after a certain year.

---

## Notes
- Each `Book` object is independent and can have its properties updated without affecting others.  
- The program demonstrates proper use of constructors, methods, and arrays in an OOP setting.  
- The activity reinforces fundamental OOP concepts, including encapsulation and object manipulation.
